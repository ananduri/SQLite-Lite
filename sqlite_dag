((Why B-trees?)
 (Searching is fast (O (log N)))
 (Inserting is fast (O (log N)))
 (Unlike a hash table,
  traversing a range of values is fast))



(How do you ensure B-trees stay balanced?
 (Nodes have to have number of children \in [m/2, m]))




(Why do B-trees have more than 2 children?
 Why do 'regular' trees have only 2 children?)





(SQLite uses both B-trees and B+ trees.
 What's the difference?)

(Internal nodes are different)

(Difference:
 (B-trees:
  internal nodes store keys and values)
 (B+ trees:
  internal nodes only store keys))
  
(Translates to:
 (B-trees:
  used for /indexes/)
 (B+ trees:
  used for /tables/))



(How to remember?
 (B-trees:
  the 'natural' definition, of internal and leaf nodes
  being symmetric)
 (B+ trees:
  the 'augmented' version for faster speed,
  where a modification, viz. removal of values from internal nodes, is made))





(How are B-trees balanced?)

(After a deletion, balancing involves
 (either
  getting donated elements from siblings
  or
  merging the node with a sibling))
  
(What about balancing after an insertion?)







(What is a page?)

(A page is the atom of 'disk'
 that the computer reads)

(Each node corresponds to one page
 Or, each node /is stored by/ one page)

(Internal nodes point to their children
 by storing the page number that stores the child)

(Pages themselves are stored in the database file
 in order of page number)
 
(A B-tree is identified by the page number
 of its root node)




(Pages are associated with a database (file),
 and not individual tables)






(If db is a simple list or array or rows
 We identify a position/row with just the row number)
 
(If db has tables stored as trees,
 We identify a position/row by the page number of the node,
 and the cell number within the node)
























(How many bits in a byte?)

;; relate to hexadecimal <-> 16

(2 hexadecimal numbers correspond to one byte)

(2 hexadecimal numbers is 16 * 16 values)
(or 2^4 * 2^4 -> 2^8, which is number of spaces in a byte)

(8)
