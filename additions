Goal is, should compile after going through all the diffs
without having to look at the complete diff at the bottom

1. switch (do_meta_command(input_buffer, table)) {
   in part 5

2. "get get" under Insertion Into a Leaf Node in part 8

3. The first diff adding the function leaf_node_num_cells
under accessing leaf node fields, in part 8
has a (char*) in front of node, in the return statement

which is not there in the final diff
and which causes a compiler warning.
